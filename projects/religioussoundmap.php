				<h1>Religious Soundmap</h1>

				<h2>Overview</h2>

				<p>
					The Religious Soundmap Project of the Global Midwest was a collaborative research project directed by co-PIs Isaac Weiner of the Ohio State University and Amy DeRogatis of Michigan State University from May 2014 - August 2016.  On this site you can hear the increasingly global character of religion in two Midwestern cities. To navigate the site, enter through the "Sound" or "Space" portal, and then filter by sound, tradition, language, instrument, or place. We invite you to think about what you can learn about religious diversity in the Midwest by listening to its aural cultures.
				</p>

				<p>
					For this project, my responsibilities were to develop a custom <a href="https://omeka.org/">Omeka</a> website site from previously designed user interfaces.
				</p>

				<h2>Process</h2>

				<p>
					By the time I joined the project, Religious Soundmap had already completed its first iteration and was going through the process of the the second. Prior to my involvement, the administrators used third party developers to set up their web space and put together the website.

				<p>
					After meeting with stakeholders and designers, I understood that what needed to be done was to

					<ol>
						<li>assist the administrators in attaining new web space,</li>
						<li>create a new installation of Omeka,</li>
						<li>develop a custom theme based off of the graphic designers' mockups, and</li>
						<li>migrate content from the first website to the new one.</li>
					</ol>

					Luckily, the first two steps of the process was relatively easy with the help of the <a href="https://msu.edu/">Michigan State University</a> <a href="http://www.cal.msu.edu/">College of Arts and Letters</a>' systems administrator.
				</p>

				<h3>Responsive Design</h3>

				<p>
					When it came time to begin developing the Omeka theme, my first challenge was that the graphic designers had only put together mockups for desktop-sized screens--I needed to augment those compositions to design tablet- and mobile-responsive versions as well.

					After several iterations with feedback from stakeholders, I settled on two sets of layouts for the tablet and mobile UI of the website. Now it was time to code.
				</p>

				<h3>Development</h3>

				<p>
					Due to the specificity of the designs, this Omeka website was unable to be built off of an existing theme but required developing one from scratch.
				</p>

				<h3>Content Migration</h3>

				<p>
					In order to complete the project on time, I collaborated with Marcus Fields, a <a href="http://www.rcah.msu.edu/">Residential College in the Arts asnd Humanities</a> (RCAH) student and fellow Innovations Team member, to have content migrated over while I was putting together the theme.
