						<p>
							I began my undergraduate degree at <a href="https://msu.edu/">Michigan State University</a> (MSU) as an computer science and engineering student. With a passion for technology, I was excited to learn how to design, develop, and bend computers to my will.

							My first working experience at Michigan State University was at the <a href="https://msu.edu/~aaas/">African American and African Studies</a> (AAAS) program where I had the opportunity to rebuild and maintain the program's website. From leading the user interface/interaction design process to developing a content strategy, I collaborated with both the program's faculty and graduate students to create an online resource that best addressed their needs.

							Despite enjoying the opportunities to learn programming and computational architecture, I kept feeling that something was missing from my educational trajectory--a human-centered focus. After speaking to Dr. Bill Hart-Davidson and learning about a brand-new major, <a href="http://xa.cal.msu.edu/">Experience Architecture</a>, I discovered that this program will allow me to continue my passion for technology while also incorporating the humanitarian/user experience approaches I was interested in.

						<p>
							With the increasing popularity of virtual reality in education, many teachers want to take advantage of this technology to engage and excite students with the lesson on a level deeper than some traditional methods. Unfortunately, due to constraints imposed by budgets, time, experience, etc., not every educator can make use of these opportunities to connect with their students.
						</p><br>
						<p>
							In response, the goal of the SketchUpSim project is to create a relatively simple and affordable means of allowing teachers, students, museum curators and other educational personnel to quickly prototype first-person, explorable virtual environments without the need for extensive technical skills and knowledge or ridiculously large budgets.

							During the 2015 <a href="http://urca.msu.edu/uuraf">University Undergraduate Research and Arts Forum</a> (UURAF), a conference that provides MSU undergraduate students with an opportunity to showcase their scholarship and creative activity, I contributed several poster sessions of my work over the past year.
						</p><br>
						<p>
							For the first session, along with my colleagues Elizabeth Oderkirk and Tylor Hoekstra, we presented our work with Dr. Ben Lauren on a new pilot study abroad platform called "AppAbroad". The goal of the app was to collect and share study abroad experiences for research and academic development purposes.
						</p><br>
						<p>
							The second session was when I presented with my colleague Eric Martin, on our work with the SketchUpSim project and the potential of virtual reality content in pedagogy.
						</p><br>
						<p>
							Finally, during the third session, when I presented with my colleague Christopher Frey, we shared our research into video game accessibilty and how this industry can continue to accomodate more communities of disabled gamers.
